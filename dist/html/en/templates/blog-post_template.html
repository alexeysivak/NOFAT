Regular exercise improves well-being, quality of life, accelerate					metabolism, help maintain flexibility and mobility of the body, promote muscle growth and increase endurance.				</p>			</div>			<div class="text_small">				<h3 class="post__content-heading">Causes of muscle pain after training</h3>				<p>There are two types of muscle pain that appear at the initial stage of sports, which are considered natural and therefore safe.</p>				<p>One occurs right during your workout, the moment you perform the last, hardest repetitions of the exercise. Why is this happening?</p>				<p>					In the process of training in muscle tissue and blood begins to decompose ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the most important source					energy. Due to this, hydrogen ions accumulate in the blood and muscles, and the Ph of the blood begins to shift towards oxidation. It is					through "Acidification" of the blood there is a burning sensation. It passes fairly quickly: blood and increased ventilation in the lungs					help the body to cope with the accumulated hydrogen ions. But all subsequent pain is associated with microdamages in muscle tissue.				</p>				<p>The second is the so-called crepitation, or delayed muscle pain.</p>				<p>					It occurs 6-8 hours after exercise and reaches a maximum in about 2-3 days. As a rule, its appearance is a consequence unusual or excessive					exercise. You have most likely experienced the crepature more than once: not only in yourself the beginning of fitness classes, but also					during the development of new sets of exercises or when increasing their duration and intensity. the cause of this species pain is					microscopic damage or even rupture of muscle fibers.				</p>				<p>					A large number of microdamages of muscles inhibits the growth of muscle tissue. This is because amino acids are needed for muscle growth,					which are also needed to heal damaged muscles. Severe muscle damage "steals" amino acids for healing, not giving them themselves, grow					muscle fibers				</p>			</div>			<div class="text_small">				<h3 class="post__content-heading">Causes of muscle pain after training</h3>				<p>					The complete opposite of natural pain is severe pain resulting from injury. This pain is aching, amplifies even from insignificant loadings					and becomes intolerable at sharp movement.				</p>				<p>The pain syndrome manifests itself immediately, during training, sometimes - the next day.</p>				<p>					If you have redness and swelling of the tissues, bruising, general malaise, it clearly indicates a serious injury to the muscles and					ligaments. IN in this case, do not delay a visit to the doctor!				</p>			</div>			<div class="text_small">				<h3 class="post__content-heading">Traumatic causes of muscle pain</h3>				<p>					We have analyzed the causes of pain, now let's talk about how to get rid of it. Safe types of pain can be relieved directly during exercise,					repeating the exercise that caused it, but with less load. These actions will remove muscle stiffness and provide increased blood flow,					oxygen-carrying tissues and nutrients necessary for regeneration.				</p>				<p>					Discomfort in the muscles of the legs and lower body can be removed with cardio, and get rid of muscle pain upper body is possible by doing					exercises with your own weight or doing yoga.				</p>				<p>If we talk about removing the crepitus, there are several effective techniques that can quickly remove the pain.</p>			</div>			<div class="share__links">				<p class="text_medium">Share</p>				<a class="share__link" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=&text=&via=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">					<picture><source srcset="../../images/icons/tweeter-share-icon.svg" type="image/webp"><img src="../../images/icons/tweeter-share-icon.svg" alt="tweeter-share" /></picture>				</a>				<a class="share__link" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">					<picture><source srcset="../../images/icons/facebook-share-icon.svg" type="image/webp"><img src="../../images/icons/facebook-share-icon.svg" alt="facebook-share" /></picture>				</a>			</div>		</div>	</div></section>
